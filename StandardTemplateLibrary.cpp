/*
STL: it is a standard template library for Generic classes and fuctions.
Why we use it (for reuse : well tasked compnents, resize, sort and search and time savings)
it was created by hp emplyees Alexendar and Mengley
what are the components of components
1. Containers: Stores Data and uses template classes
2. Algoritms: Sorting, Searching, Using template funtions
3. Iterators: Iteraor is a object points to an element in a container.
    --->Handeled just like pointers.
    --->Connects Algorithms with containers.
There are three types of containers
1. Sequence Containers (Stores Data in linear fastion for instance vectors, lists, Dequeue)
2. Associate Containers (Stores Data in Direct Access used for fast searching, fast access
for instance Dictionaries, set, )
3. Derived Containers (Stack, queue, Priority queue)
1. Stack: it is a LIFO structue which works as first in last out.
2. Queue: it is a FIFO structue which works as first in first out.
3. Priority Queue: A priority queue in c++ is a type of container adapter, 
which processes only the highest priority element, i.e. the first element 
will be the maximum of all elements in the queue, and elements are in 
decreasing order.

Comparasion:
Sequence Containers-> 
---->Vectors
In vectors Random Access is fast for instance 
and insertion and deletion will be slow in midle but fast in last
---->List
In vectors Random Access is slow for instance
and insertion in middle is slow but slow in last.
Assosiation->
all operations are fast except random access
Derived Containers: totally depends on data structures.
